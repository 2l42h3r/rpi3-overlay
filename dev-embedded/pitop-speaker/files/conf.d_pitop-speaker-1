# Set the following array to specify each of the pitopSPEAKER units
# plugged in to your system, which the pitop-speaker service will initialize
# on boot.
#
# Valid entries are:
#   l : a speaker set to left-channel operation (that's an ell, not a one)
#   r : a speaker set to right-channel operation
#   m : a speaker set to mono operation
#
# So, for example, if you have two pitopSPEAKER units, one set to left and the
# other right, you would specify:
# SPEAKERS_TO_INITIALIZE=( l r )
# Whereas if you just had a single unit, set to mono (the most common case),
# you would specify:
# SPEAKERS_TO_INITIALIZE=( m )
# If you want the driver to attempt automatically to detect your speaker(s)
# (if any), set:
# SPEAKERS_TO_INITIALIZE=( auto )
SPEAKERS_TO_INITIALIZE=( auto )

# Set the following to 1 to have the pitop-speaker service automatically
# force ALSA PCM output to route via HDMI (this is what the pitopSPEAKER units
# are connected to, via the hub). Set to 0 to leave the PCM routing unchanged.
SET_ALSA_PCM_ROUTE_AS_HDMI=1
